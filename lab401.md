# Splunk Observability Suite GDI: 401

Goals:

- Learn how to troubleshoot the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector
- Learn how to troubleshoot instrumentation libraries
- Learn troubleshooting techniques for common issues

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes you completed lab101. If you have not, you must complete at
least the `Instrument an application to emit data` section before continuing.
In addition, you should ensure the docker containers from lab101 are not
running or they will cause port conflicts with this lab. Run `docker ps` and
shut down any containers from lab101 before continuing.

Once done, please run:

```bash
cd demo-app/tracing-examples/signalfx-tracing/
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector

Check the health of `otelcol-agent` and `otelcol-gateway` and fix any issues.

- How do you access zpages?

## Instrumentation libraries

Are any spans being received by the `otelcol-agent`? If not, why?

Open `demo-app/extras/docker-compose.yml` and with `java:` under `environment:`
add `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT: http://otelcol-agent:14268/api/traces`.
Start up the docker-compose again -- does it work now?

- Why is this needed?

## Common issues

### Span not found in Splunk APM

- Any errors in application logs?
- Are you sure instrumentation is properly configured?
- Have you checked debug logs?

- Any errors on Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector? Check logs and zpages.
- Add logging exporter and confirm data is being exported as expected

### Metric or Log not found in Infrastructure Monitoring or Log Observer

- Any errors on Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector? Check logs and zpages.
- Add logging exporter and confirm data is being exported as expected
